I found it useful for myself to be able to see all the class names on one screen
so in case anyone else wants to be able to visualise a basic overview all at
once here it is:

Normal classes (data 'n' stuff):

public class PlacesDatabase // singleton object with query functions
public class PlaceData // what's stored in the database
public class GlobalSettings // singleton object for global settings
public class GPSService // basically a wrapper for getting location
public class RadarComponent // the radar
public class RangeSliderComponent // oh so obvious

Activities (screens):

public class MainScreenActivity extends Activity  // central screen
public class PlaceFullInfoActivity // how to display full information
public class SettingsPanelActivity // where GlobalSettings handled
public class FilterPanelActivity // filter settings stored in GlobalSettings
public class ListPlacesActivity // Listing places
public class RoutePlannerActivity // planning routes manually.  simple
public class AutoPlannerActivity // plans routes automatically.  yay
